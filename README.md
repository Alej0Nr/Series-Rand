This project allows you to get a randomized episode from a TV series using the TMDB API.

You input the name of a series you're interested in, and the program returns up to 5 related series. After selecting the one you want, it will randomly pick a season and an episode for you to watch. It also provides a direct link to the selected season and episode on TMDB.
